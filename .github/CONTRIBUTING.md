## Contributing Guide

1. Keep your branch up-to-date
    - `git fetch upstream`
    - `git rebase upstream/master`
2. Squash or reword commits for clear history
    - `git rebase -i --autosquash upstream/master`
3. Create a pull request
    - Edit the description
    - Invite one or multiple reviewers
    - Assign someone who can merge pull requests
    - Choose labels and milestone
    - If there is a topic-related Trello card, attach this pull request on it
